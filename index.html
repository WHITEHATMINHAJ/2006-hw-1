        <p>A proforma invoice is a key element in your whole business finance and invoice system. Ultimately, it is essential to have one, so you can get paid by your buyers. As a business owner, you are not likely to get very excited about creating and sending invoices, but you’ve got to keep the cash flowing and that’s why you need to understand what a proforma invoice is; how it fits with all the other different types of invoice; what it contains, and how and when to use one. Receiving payments from your customers is of crucial importance for your business’ survival, so anything that helps you make this process easier and less daunting can only be a plus
        <p>

            <h4>What is a proforma invoice?</h4>

            <p>Starting with the basics, let’s see what a proforma invoice actually is. Simply put, a proforma invoice is not a real invoice, but a preliminary estimate of what the cost of the goods and services will be. In this sense, it’s closer to a quote or a ‘good faith’ agreement between you and the buyer. For those already familiar with the term, it’s a provisional bill of sale and it’s always for goods or services not yet rendered. This means that the terms in a proforma invoice can be subject to change.</p>
        
        <h4>Reasons for issuing a proforma invoice</h4>

        <p>There are a variety of reasons why a business would want or need to issue a proforma invoice, prior to sending a final one. </p>
        
    
        <p>A proforma invoice:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Gives your buyers/clients detailed information about what products/services they’ll receive, at what price and by when; </li>
            <br> <li>Serves as a proof of your obligation as a supplier to ship the goods or provide the services at an agreed price;</li>
      <br> <li>Helps the customer to decide whether they want to go ahead with the purchase;</li>
     <br>  <li>Serves as a declaration of the value of the goods for customs in order to make the delivery process smoother; </li>
       <br><li>Helps your customer to internally finalize the purchase order process as it will serve as proof of your obligation to deliver for the internal procurement and buying teams;  </li> 
   <br> <li>Can be changed if prices or delivery dates are not suitable for the customer or delivery dates need to be moved forward, due to a change of circumstances for the organization buying your goods or services (such as new deadlines, the need for urgent delivery, or a change in the mode of shipping).

 <h4>When should I send a proforma invoice?</h4>

<p>As a rule of thumb, a proforma invoice should always be sent prior to delivering the goods or providing the services that you’ve agreed on with your customer. And here’s the key point: ‘agreed on’. It’s important to remember that a proforma is usually sent only after you have a commitment from your customer that he/she intends to buy from you. In this case, you wouldn’t be sending an official (sales) invoice because the terms might not have been finalized, or the buying process in the customer’s organization requires that final invoices are only sent upon receipt of goods or services. In cases such as these, a proforma invoice gives you the flexibility to continue negotiating the finer details, while still keeping the level of commitment high, so you don’t lose the deal.
